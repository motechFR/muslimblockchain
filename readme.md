# Preamble

Islam is arguably the most holistic religion in the world.

It provides insights and guidance for Muslims across a broad range of topics
relating to all areas of life.

Muslims inherently know that Islam was the catalyst for some of the [biggest
innovations](http://www.1001inventions.com/) in the modern world.

Some of these included: algebra, optics, architectural innovations, islamic arts,
calligraphy, knowledge translation, women's rights, cheques and money, etc.

In the last approximately 600 years Islamic world has seen a stagnation in terms of
socio-economic progress.

While the [richest man in the history of the world was a Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_I_of_Mali),
many Muslims today live in deep poverty and backwards lifestyles.

Much of this is to do with the complication around effectively distributing
monetary wealth around [Ummah](#ummah) in a direct and fast fashion.

Today however, it is possible to do exactly that with modern Blockchain technology.

# Purpose

Enable second [Islamic renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age)
through transparent technological implementation of Islamic economy through use of Blockchain technology.

# People

Overall target community for this project are 1.3 billion Muslims worldwide.

## Individuals

These are the core users of Muslim Blockchain and Muslim Wallet.

### Ordinary Muslims

The basic form of users for Muslim Blockchain are ordinary Muslims who are living their regular day to day lives.

### Muslim Merchants

Many Muslims are quite entrepreneurial, running corner shops, crafts shops, farms and many other types of businesses.

### Imams

Imams are important users as they are big influencers in Ummah worldwide and are core representatives for mosques worldwide.

### Wealthy Muslims

Many Muslims are super wealthy, running their own banks and many big size businesses.

## Organisations

### Mosques

Blockchain shows itself to be a perfect technology for charitable donation collection.

Mosques have this need all the time.

Muslim Blockchain will enable instant, direct, charitable donations from Muslims to mosques around the world in physical and virtual ways.

After every Friday prayer a mosque can collect donations from Muslims and know exactly how much they have collected that Friday.

All the mosque funds will be made transparent to all the Muslims who want to check the financials of each mosque.

### Charities

Muslim charities can use Muslim Blockchain to gather instant funds from Ummah around the world in real time.

### Education Institutions

Schools and universities can use Muslim Blockchain to both collect funding as well as issue out student loans and bursaries to Muslim students.

### Islamic Banks

Islamic banking is becoming more and more popular with Muslims and non Muslims around the world.

Muslim Blockchain enables Islamic Banks to enter the age of cryptocurrencies in a seamless and painless way.

All the rules of Islamic Banking are pre-coded into Muslim Blockchain by default.

# Systems

## Codified Islamic Economy

Qur'an is a very specific book in its teachings around everything in life.

This is especially the case within the financial aspects of life.

Islamic rules of money are very clear.

### Islamic Rules of Money

Money itself has no intrinsic value.

It is simply a medium of exchange.

Each unit is 100% equal in value to another unit of the same denomination and a Muslim
is not allowed to make a profit by exchanging cash with another Muslim.

A Muslim is not allowed to benefit from lending money or receiving money.

Charging or earning interest (riba) is not allowed.

### Islamic Financial Instruments

These are financial instruments offered by Islamic banks which comply with Islamic
economic principles.

Muslims who are wealthier can set up their own Islamic Banks through the Muslim
Blockchain and automatically comply with Islamic economic principles.



### Islamic Banking

Banks can profit from the buying and selling of approved goods and services.

The principal means of Islamic finance are based on trading.

It is essential that risk be involved in any trading activity.

Banks and financial institutions will trade in Islamic compliant investments with
Muslim Coins deposited by customers, sharing the risks, and the profits between them.

Islamic banks are structured so that they retain a clearly differentiated status
between shareholders' capital and clients' deposits in order to make sure profits
are shared correctly.

Banks can profit from helping customers to purchase a property using a
**ijara** or **murabaha** scheme.

With an ijara scheme the bank makes money by charging the customer rent.

With a murabaha scheme a price is agreed at the outset which is more than the
market value.

This profit is deemed to be a reward for the risk that is assumed by the bank.

### Trading Laws

Firm laws govern the types of businesses Muslims can trade with.

There should be absolutely no investment in unsuitable businesses, including those
involved with: armaments, pork, tobacco, drugs, alcohol or pornography.

# Innovation

## Why Blockchain?

The ethos of blockchain technology goes directly in line with the ethos of Islam.

Islam and Blockchain both:

* Have decentralised governance
* Work on transparent principles
* Are direct person-to-person protocols
* Are driven by network (Ummah)
* Support ethical economy

# Products

## Transparent Blockchain Network

Muslim Blockchain is a transparent, decentralised Blockchain network which enables
transfer of Zakat Coins between all participants in the system.

## Muslim Wallet

Each Muslim around the world uses a Muslim wallet which enables them to exchange
Muslim Coins with Muslims worldwide.

## Muslim POS

Muslim Blockchain is an instant POS (Point Of Sale) system which allows Muslims
sellers of any kind to accept Muslim Coin simply through the Muslim Wallet.

Any Muslim around the world can instantly become a merchant just like during the
beginning of Islamic period.

Muslim POS runs outside of jurisdiction of any local governments and enables Muslims
around the world to directly trade with one another with Muslims Coins.

## Block Explorer

Ability to check all transactions on Muslim Blockchain network and which wallet sent
how many Muslim Coins to which wallet.

# Money

## Muslim Coin

Muslim Coin is uniquely designed for Muslims around the world to trade in line
with well established Islamic economic rules.

Muslim Coin is Halal by design.

## Zakat

Muslim Coin implements the Islamic concept of Zakat.

[Zakat](#zakat) is a charitable annual gift given directly from a Muslim to another
Muslim.

Allah tells all Muslims to give away 2.5% of their total wealth as Zakat.

Muslim Blockchain automatically calculates Zakat each Muslim needs to donate
based on their wallet value.

It is not allowed to give Zakat via an intermediary.  

Typically Muslims give Zakat on yearly basis.

Muslim Blockchain enables Muslims to give Zakat on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly
or yearly basis, giving more flexibility to financial management and more liquid
access to funds across the whole Ummah.

## Zakat-ul-Fitr (Fitrana)

At the end of each Ramadan, Muslim Wallet calculates and prompts all Muslims to donate
their [Zakat-ul-Fitr](#Zakat-ul-Fitr) to those Muslims that need it the most.

## Tokenomics

### Supply

Total supply of Muslim Coins is 100,000,000,000,000 (one hundred trillion).

The reason for this is that within a world with ten billion population, each Muslim would have ~1000 Muslim Coins they could have access to if it was evenly distributed.

This seems like a right number to make Muslim Coins feel both scarce as well as abundant in supply.

Once Muslim Coins are issued on the Blockchain there will never be more of them issued again.

This prevents coin deflation through additional printing, like it is the case with regular banks at the moment.

### Distribution

### Mining

### Value

Muslim Coin is pegged to gold as a value standards for its intrinsic worth as per rules defined in Qur'an.

1 Muslim Coin is worth 1 milligram of gold.

1000 Muslim Coins are worth 1 gram of gold.

This means that Muslims who own Muslim Coin can exchange 1000 Muslim Coins for 1 gram of gold (or its current market value equivalent in fiat in the open world).

Crypto and fiat exchanges can be more speculative on the value of Muslim Coin for those who want to speculate on it.

This does not change the open market principles and value of Muslim Coin however.

It simply gives Muslims an opportunity to potentially acquire Muslim Coins at a value that is perhaps less than the open world value.

### Exchanging

Muslim Coin will be listed on crypto exchanges around the world.

This enables Muslims to exchange their Muslim Coins for other crypto or fiat currencies they prefer or need to have.

The exchange rate will be determined by the open market.

[Fiat](#fiat) value of Muslim Coin should not affect decisions made on pricing of goods in Muslim Coins by Muslim merchants around the world.

# Growth

## Muslims

Each Muslim around the world downloads and uses Muslim Wallet to send and receive
Zakat in a transparent way that is accountable to themselves and the entire Ummah.

## Mosques

Muslims promote Muslim wallet to each other in mosques around the world.

Mosques use Muslim Wallet also for automatic and direct collection of donations
directly from Muslims praying in mosques.

## Muslim Merchants

A big benefit of using Muslim Blockchain is to connect Muslim merchants around the world
in a direct way with other Muslim merchants and their customers.

Muslim Blockchain will enable a more direct growth of Muslim enterprises by enabling an
alternative form of payment outside of control of local governments.
